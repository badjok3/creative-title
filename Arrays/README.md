1.	Day of Week
Enter a day number [1…7] and print the day name (in English) or “Invalid Day!”. Use an array of strings.

2.	Reverse an Array of Integers
Write a program to read an array of integers, reverse it and print its elements. The input consists of a number n (the number of elements) + n integers, each as a separate line. Print the output on a single line (space separated).


3.	Last K Numbers Sums Sequence
Enter two integers n and k. Generate and print the following sequence of n elements:<br>
•	The first element is: 1<br>
•	All other elements = sum of the previous k elements (if less than k are available, sum all of them)<br>
•	Example: n = 9, k = 5  120 = 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 61

4.	Triple Sum
Write a program to read an array of integers and find all triples of elements a, b and c, such that a + b == c (where a stays left from b). Print “No” if no such triples exist.

5.	Rounding Numbers Away from Zero
Write a program to read an array of real numbers (space separated values), round them to the nearest integer in “away from 0” style and print the output.<br>
Rounding in “away from zero” style means:<br>
•	To round to the nearest integer, e.g. 2.9  3; -1.75  -2<br>
•	In case the number is exactly in the middle of two integers (midpoint value), round it to the next integer which is away from the 0:

6.	Reverse an Array of Strings
Write a program to read an array of strings, reverse it and print its elements. The input consists of a sequence of space separated strings. Print the output on a single line (space separated).

7.	Sum Arrays
Write a program that reads two arrays of integers and sums them. When the arrays are not of the same size, duplicate the smaller array a few times.
