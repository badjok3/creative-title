The input comes as a single number argument.<br>
The output is a series of lines printed on the console, forming a rectangle of variable size

3.	Palindrome

•	Sum(1/ai) - calculates the sum of the inverse values (1/ai) of all elements from the array<br>
•	Concat(ai) - concatenates the string representations of all elements from the array<br>
The input comes as an array of number elements.<br>
The output should be printed on the console on a new line for each of the operations.

7.	*Words Uppercase
