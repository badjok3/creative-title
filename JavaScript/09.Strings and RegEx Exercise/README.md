I.Text Processing and String Manipulation

1 -	Split a String with a Delimiter
Write a JS function that splits a string with a given delimiter.<br>
The input comes as 2 string arguments. The first one is the string you need to split and the second one is the delimiter.<br>
The output should consist of all elements you’ve received, after you’ve split the given string by the given delimiter. Each element should be printed on a new line.

2 - Repeat a String N Times
Write a JS function that repeats a given string, N times.<br>
The input comes as 2 arguments. The first argument is a string that will represent the one you need to repeat. The second one is a number will represent the times you need to repeat it.<br>
The output is a big string, containing the given one, repeated N times.

3 -	Check if String starts with a given Substring.
Write a JS function that checks if a given string, starts with a given substring.<br>
The input comes as 2 string arguments. The first string will represent the main one. The second one will represent the substring.<br>
The output is either “true” or “false” based on the result of the check.<br>
The comparison is case-sensitive!

4 -	Check if String ends with given Substring.
Write a JS function that checks if a given string, ends with a given substring.<br>
The input comes as 2 string arguments. The first string will represent the main one. The second one will represent the substring.<br>
The output is either “true” or “false” based on the result of the check.<br>
The comparison is case-sensitive!

5 -	*Capitalize the Words
Write a JS function that capitalizes the given words. You need to make every word’s first letter – uppercase and all other letters – lowercase. <br>
The input comes as a single string, containing words, separated by a space.<br>
The output is the same string, however with all of its words capitalized.<br>
Note: The words can contain any ASCII character. You need to affect only the letters.

II.Working with Regular Expressions

6 -	Capture the Numbers
Write a JS function that finds all numbers in a sequence of strings.<br>
The input comes as array of strings. Each element represents one of the strings.<br>
The output is all the numbers, extracted and printed on a single line – each separated by a single space.

7 -	Find Variable Names in Sentences
Write a JS function that finds all variable names in a given string. A variable name starts with an underscore (“_”) and contains only Capital and Non-Capital English Alphabet letters and digits. Extract only their names, without the underscore. Try to do this only with regular expressions.<br>
The input comes as single string, on which you have to perform the matching.<br>
The output consists of all variable names, extracted and printed on a single line, each separated by a comma.

8 -	Find Occurrences of Word in Sentence
Write a JS function that finds, how many times a given word, is used in a given sentence. Note that letter case does not matter – it is case-insensitive. <br>
The input comes as 2 string arguments. The first one will be the sentence, and the second one – the word.<br>
The output is a single number indicating the amount of times the sentence contains the word.
