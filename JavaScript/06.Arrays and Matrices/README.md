1.	Sum First Last
Write a JS function that calculates and prints the sum of the first and the last elements in an array.<br>
The input comes as array of string elements holding numbers.<br>
The output is the return value of your function.

2.	Even Position Element
Write a JS function that finds the elements at even positions in an array.<br>
The input comes as array of string elements.<br>
The output is the return value of your function. Collect all elements in a string, separated by space.

3.	Negative / Positive Numbers
Write a JS function that processes the elements in an array one by one and produces a new array. Prepend each negative element at the front of the result and append each positive (or 0) element at the end of the result.<br>
The input comes as array of number elements.<br>
The output is printed on the console, each element on a new line.

4.	First and Last K Numbers
Write a JS function that prints the first k and the last k elements from an array of numbers.<br>
The input comes as array of number elements. The first element represents the number k, all other elements are from the array that needs to be processed.<br>
The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line print the first k elements, separated by space. On the second line print the last k elements, separated by space.

5.	Last K Numbers Sequence
You are given two integers n and k. Write a JS function that generates and prints the following sequence:<br>
•	The first element is 1<br>
•	Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements<br>
•	The length of the sequence is n elements<br>
The input comes as two number arguments. The first element represents the number n, and the second – the number k.<br>
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

6.	Process Odd Numbers
You are given an array of numbers. Write a JS function that prints the elements at odd positions from the array, doubled and in reverse order.<br>
The input comes as array of number elements.<br>
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

7.	Smallest Two Numbers
Write a JS function that prints the two smallest elements from an array of numbers.<br>
The input comes as array of number elements.<br>
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

8.	Biggest Element
Write a JS function that finds the biggest element inside a matrix.<br>
The input comes as array of arrays, containing number elements (2D matrix of numbers).<br>
The output is the return value of your function. Find the biggest element and return it.

9.	Diagonal Sums
A square matrix of numbers comes as an array of strings, each string holding numbers (space separated). Write a JS function that finds the sum at the main and at the secondary diagonals.<br>
The input comes as array of arrays, containing number elements (2D matrix of numbers).<br>
The output is printed on the console, on a single line separated by space. First print the sum at the main diagonal, then the sum at the secondary diagonal.

10.	Equal Neighbors
Write a JS function that finds the number of equal neighbor pairs inside a matrix of variable size and type (numbers or strings).<br>
The input comes as array of arrays, containing string elements (2D matrix of strings).<br>
The output is return value of you function. Save the number of equal pairs you find and return it.
