1.	Aggregates
Write a JS program that uses a reducer function to display information about an input array.

2.	Currency Format
Write a higher-order JS function that fixes some of the parameters of another function. Your program will receive a function that takes 4 parameters and returns a formatted string (a monetary value with currency symbol). Your task is to return another function that only takes one parameter and returns the same formatted string.

3.	Command Processor
Write a JS program that keeps a string inside it’s context and can execute different commands that modify or output the string on the console.
append(str) – add str to the end of the internal string
removeStart(n) – remove the first n characters from the string, n is an integer
removeEnd(n) – remove the last n characters from the string, n is an integer
print – output the stored string to the console

4.	Max Element
Write a JS program that takes an array of numeric elements as input and returns the largest element of the array.

5.	Next Article
Write a JS program that sequentially displays articles on a web page when the user clicks a button. You will receive an array of strings that will initialize the program. You need to return a function that keeps the initial array in its closure and every time it’s called, it takes the first element from the array and displays it on the web page, inside a div with ID "content". If there are no more elements left, your function should do nothing.
