1.	Subtraction
A HTML page holds two text fields "firstNumber" and "secondNumber". Write a JS function to subtract the values from these text fields and display the result in a div named "result".

2.	Fill Dropdown
Your task is to take values from input fields with id’s “newItemText” and “newItemValue” and create and append an <option> to the <select> with id “menu”.

3.	Accordion
An html file is given and your task is to show more/show less information by clicking a button (it is not an actual button, but a span that has an onlick event attached to it). When More link is clicked, it reveals the contents of a hidden div and change the text of the link to Less. When the same link is clicked again (now reading Less), hide the div and change the text of the link back. Link action should be toggleable (you should be able to click the button infinite amount of times).

4.	Sections
You will receive an array of strings. For each string, create a div with a paragraph with the string in it. Each paragraph is initially hidden. Add a click event listener to each div that displays the hidden paragraph. Finally you should append all divs to the element with id “content”.

5.	Notification
Write a JS function that receives a string message and displays it inside a div with id "notification" for 2 seconds. The div starts hidden and when the function is called, reveal it. After 2 seconds, hide the div. In the example document, a notification is shown when you click the button.

6.	Time Converter
Create a JS app to convert between diferent time units. Your task is to add a click event listener to all buttons. When a button is clicked, read the corresponding input field and convert the value to the three other units of time and display it in the input fields.
