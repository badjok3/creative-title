1.	List of Items
Write a JS function that read the text inside an input field and appends the specified text to a list inside an HTML page.

2.	Add and Delete
Extend the previous problem to display a [Delete] link after each list item. Clicking it, should delete the item with no confirmation.

3.	Delete from Table
Write a JS program that takes an e-mail from an input field and deletes matching rows from a table. If no entry is found, an error should be displayed in a <div> with ID "results". The error should read "Not found."<br>

4.	Stopwatch
Write a JS program that implements a web timer that supports minutes and seconds. The user should be able to control it with buttons. Clicking [Start] resets the timer back to zero. Only one of the buttons should be enabled at a time (you cannot stop the timer if it’s not running).<br>

5.	Mouse Gradient
Write a JS program that detects and displays how far along a gradient the user has moved their mouse on a webpage. Use the provided HTML and stylesheet (CSS) to test locally. The resulting value should be rounded down and displayed as a percentage inside the <div> with ID "result".<br>

6.	Highlight Active
Write a JS function to highlight the currently active section of a document. There will be multiple divs with inputs inside them – set the class of the div, that contains the currently focused input field to "focus". When focus is lost (blurred) remove the class from the element.<br>

7.	Dynamic Validation
Write a JS function that dynamically validates an email input field. If the input is invalid, apply to it the style "error".<br>
A valid email will be in format: <name>@<domain>.<extension><br>
Only lowercase Latin characters are allowed for any of the parts of the email. If the input is valid, clear the style.
