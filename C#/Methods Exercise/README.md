1.	Hello, Name!
Write a method that receives a name as parameter and prints on the console. “Hello, <name>!”

2.	Max Method
Create a method GetMax(int a, int b), that returns maximal of two numbers. Write a program that reads three numbers from the console and prints the biggest of them. Use the GetMax(…) method you just created.

3.	English Name оf The Last Digit
Write a method that returns the English name of the last digit of a given number. Write a program that reads an integer and prints the returned value from this method.

4.	Numbers in Reversed Order
Write a method that prints the digits of a given decimal number in a reversed order.

5.	Fibonacci Numbers
Define a method Fib(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. 

6.	Prime Checker
Write a Boolean method IsPrime(n) that check whether a given integer number n is prime. 

7.	* Primes in Given Range
Write a method that calculates all prime numbers in given range and returns them as list of integers:

8.	Center Point
You are given the coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2 and Y2. Create a method that prints the point that is closest to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0) in the format (X, Y). If the points are on a same distance from the center, print only the first one.

9.	Longer Line
You are given the coordinates of four points in the 2D plane. The first and the second pair of points form two different lines. Print the longer line in format "(X1, Y1)(X2, Y2)" starting with the point that is closer to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0) (You can reuse the method that you wrote for the previous problem). If the lines are of equal length, print only the first one.

10.	Cube Properties
Write a program that can calculate the length of the face diagonals, space diagonals, volume and surface area of a cube by a given side. On the first line you will get the side of the cube. On the second line is given the parameter (face, space, volume or area).
Output should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point.

11.	Geometry Calculator
Write a program that can calculate the area of four different geometry figures - triangle, square, rectangle and circle.
On the first line you will get the figure type. Next you will get parameters for the chosen figure, each on a different line:<br>
•	Triangle - side and height<br>
•	Square - side<br>
•	Rectangle - width and height<br>
•	Circle - radius<br>
The output should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point.

12.	Master Numbers
A master number is an integer that holds the following properties:<br>
•	Is symmetric (palindrome), e.g. 5, 77, 282, 14341, 9553559.<br>
•	Its sum of digits is divisible by 7, e.g. 77, 313, 464, 5225, 37173.<br>
•	Holds at least one even digit, e.g. 232, 707, 6886, 87578.<br>
Write a program to print all master numbers in the range [1…n].

13.	* Factorial
Write a program that calculates and prints the n! for any n in the range [1…1000].

14.	Factorial Trailing Zeroes
Create a program that counts the trailing zeroes of the factorial of a given number.
