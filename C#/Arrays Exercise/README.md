1.	Largest Common End
Read two arrays of words and find the length of the largest common end (left or right).

2.	Rotate and Sum
To “rotate an array on the right” means to move its last element first: {1, 2, 3}  {3, 1, 2}.
Write a program to read an array of n integers (space separated on a single line) and an integer k, rotate the array right k times and sum the obtained arrays after each rotation .

3.	Fold and Sum 
Read an array of 4*k integers, fold it like shown below, and print the sum of the upper and lower two rows (each holding 2 * k integers).

4.	Sieve of Eratosthenes
Write a program to find all prime numbers in range [1…n]. Implement the algorithm called “Sieve of Eratosthenes”.

5.	Compare Char Arrays
Compare two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
Print the them in alphabetical order, each on separate line.

6.	Max Sequence of Equal Elements
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of integers. If several longest sequences exist, print the leftmost one.

7.	Max Sequence of Increasing Elements
Write a program that finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array of integers. The longest increasing subsequence is a portion of the array (subsequence) that is strongly increasing and has the longest possible length. If several such subsequences exist, find the left most of them.

8.	Most Frequent Number
Write a program that finds the most frequent number in a given sequence of numbers. <br>
•	Numbers will be in the range [0…65535].<br>
•	In case of multiple numbers with the same maximal frequency, print the leftmost of them.

9.	Index of Letters
Write a program that creates an array containing all letters from the alphabet (a-z). Read a lowercase word from the console and print the index of each of its letters in the letters array.

10.	Pairs by Difference
Write a program that count the number of pairs in given array which difference is equal to given number.

11.	Equal Sums
Write a program that determines if there exists an element in the array such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. If there are no elements to the left / right, their sum is considered to be 0. Print the index that satisfies the required condition or “no” if there is no such index.
