1.	Remove Negatives and Reverse
Read a list of integers, remove all negative numbers from it and print the remaining elements in reversed order. In case of no elements left in the list, print “empty”.

2.	Append Lists
Write a program to append several lists of numbers. <br>
	Lists are separated by ‘|’. <br>
	Values are separated by spaces (‘ ’, one or several). <br>
	Order the lists from the last to the first, and their values from left to right.

3.	Sum Adjacent Equal Numbers
Write a program to sum all adjacent equal numbers in a list of decimal numbers, starting from left to right. <br>
	After two numbers are summed, the obtained result could be equal to some of its neighbors and should be summed as well. <br>
	Always sum the leftmost two equal neighbors (if several couples of equal neighbors are available).

4.	Split by Word Casing
Read a text, split it into words and distribute them into 3 lists. <br>
	Lower-case words like “programming”, “at” and “databases” – consist of lowercase letters only. <br>
	Upper-case words like “PHP”, “JS” and “SQL” – consist of uppercase letters only. <br>
	Mixed-case words like “C#”, “SoftUni” and “Java” – all others. <br>
Use the following separators between the words: , ; : . ! ( ) " ' \ / [ ] space

5.	Sort Numbers
Read a list of decimal numbers and sort them in increasing order.

6.	Square Numbers
Read a list of integers and extract all square numbers from it and print them in descending order. A square number is an integer which is the square of any integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are square numbers.

7.	Count Numbers
Read a list of integers in range [0…1000] and print them in ascending order along with their number of occurrences.
