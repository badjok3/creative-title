1.	Practice Integer Numbers
Create a new C# project and create a program that assigns integer values to variables. Be sure that each value is stored in the correct variable type (try to find the most suitable variable type in order to save memory). Finally, you need to print all variables to the console.

2.	Practice Floating Point Numbers
Create a new C# project and create a program that assigns floating point values to variables. Be sure that each value is stored in the correct variable type (try to find the most suitable variable type in order to save memory). Finally, you need to print all variables to the console.

3.	Practice Characters and Strings
Create a new C# project and create a program that assigns character and string values to variables. Be sure that each value is stored in the correct variable. Finally, you need to print all variables to the console.

4.	Variable in Hexadecimal Format
Write a program that reads a number in hexadecimal format (0x##) convert it to decimal format and prints it.

5.	Boolean Variable
Write a program that reads a string, converts it to Boolean variable and prints “Yes” if the variable is true and “No” if the variable is false.

6.	Strings and Objects
Declare two string variables and assign them with “Hello” and “World”. Declare an object variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval between). Declare a third string variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).

7.	Exchange Variable Values
Declare two integer variables a and b and assign them with 5 and 10 and after that exchange their values by using some programming logic. Print the variable values before and after the exchange, as shown below:

8.	Employee Data
A marketing company wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics:
•	First name
•	Last name
•	Age (0...100)
•	Gender (m or f)
•	Personal ID number (e.g. 8306112507)
•	Unique employee number (27560000…27569999)
Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate primitive data types. Use descriptive names. Print the data at the console.

9.	Reverse Characters
Write a program to ask the user for 3 letters and print them in reversed order.

10.	Centuries to Nanoseconds
Write program to enter an integer number of centuries and convert it to years, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds.

11.	Convert Speed Units
Create a program to ask the user for a distance (in meters) and the time taken (as three numbers: hours, minutes, seconds), and print the speed, in meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour.
Assume 1 mile = 1609 meters.

12.	Rectangle Properties
Create a program to calculate rectangle’s perimeter, area and diagonal by given its width and height.

13.	Vowel or Digit
Create a program to check if given symbol is digit, vowel or any other symbol.

14.	Integer to Hex and Binary
Create a program to convert a decimal number to hexadecimal and binary number and print it.

15.	Fast Prime Checker - Refactor
You are given a program that checks if numbers in a given range [2...N] are prime. For each number is printed "{number} is prime -> {True or False}". The code however, is not very well written. Your job is to modify it in a way that is easy to read and understand.

16.	* Comparing Floats
Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001. Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than some fixed constant eps. Examples:

17.	Print Part of the ASCII Table
Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints part of the ASCII table of characters at the console.  On the first line of input you will receive the char index you should start with and on the second line - the index of the last character you should print.

18.	* Different Integers Size
Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

19.	* Thea the Photographer
This problem is from the Programming Fundamentals Retake Exam (11 September 2016).
Thea is a photographer. She takes pictures of people on special events. She is a good friend and you want to help her.
She wants to inform her clients when their pictures will be ready. Since the number of pictures is big and it requires time for editing (#nofilter, #allnatural) every single picture - you decide to write a program in order to help her.
Thea follows this pattern: first she takes all pictures. Then she goes through every single picture to filter these pictures that are considered "good". Then she needs to upload every single filtered picture to her cloud. She is considered ready when all filtered pictures are uploaded in her picture storage.
You will receive the amount of pictures she had taken. Then the approximate time in seconds for every picture to be filtered. Then a filter factor – a percentage (integer number) of the total photos (rounded to the nearest bigger integer value e.g. 5.01 -> 6) that are good enough to be given to her clients (Photoshop may do miracles but Thea does not). Approximate time for every picture to be uploaded will be given again in seconds. Your task is: based on this input to display total time needed for her to be ready with the pictures in given below format.
